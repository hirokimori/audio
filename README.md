# audio subtitler

This is for the website which hosts audio and text files where part of the text which contains the script is displayed while the audio is being played.
By specifying the time stamps in the text file with the format {mm:ss}, the displayed text can be synchronized with the audio.
This should be helpful when learning foreign languages.
